					<h2>About Kye</h2>
					<p>My name is Kye and I am a 3rd year transfer at UCSC. I took this class because I 
						wanna be a front-end developer and the class seemed very interesting. I have some 
						experience in developing, but I forgot a lot of it. I'm from San Diego and have been
						living in San Jose for the last year and a half(I miss San Diego). In my free time I like
						to play video games, go to the gym, I want to learn how to surf, and I want to start doing 
						more pottery and ceramics. Peace n love.
