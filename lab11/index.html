        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>
            The challenge of this lab was to create an event that takes user input and then does something with it. In this case it was take the user input and
             either sort it or make it an anagram. 
        </p>

<!--Problems section-->
    <div id="problems">
        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>
            I ran into a few problems with this lab, mostly in the JS. The sorting function that was made did not take into consideration the CAPITAL letters from the user's input and
            would sort it with the capital letter in the middle of the sorted name if need be. I ran my code through GPT-4.0 and asked it to identify the problems and it was fixed within minutes.
            I ran into the same problem, but with the anagram function, BUT I did not think the capital letters needed to be sorted for this since it's just making an anagram out of your name. The last issue
            I ran into was the JS not displaying at all, but I realized it was because I did not put a section for the output to be actually displayed, so I fixed that.
        </p>

<!--Results section-->

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
            I'm actually very happy with the way this lab turned out. Click the buttons below to either sort your input or make it an anagram!
