			<h1>Hello World!</h1>
			<p>
				My name is Kye Gorosave and I'm a third year transfer from San Diego. I took this class because
				I've always thought web development was interesting and this class seemed fun. In my free time I like
				to play video games, watch movies, play volleyball, and I want to learn to surf!

				My name is Kaiwen Su, you can call me Kevin. I am a senior student at UCSC,
				majoring in game design. In my spare time, I would play video games which you can
				tell from my major. However, I am also a soccer player and trombone player. I was part
				of the brass band in my High School career and participated in several significant
				parades in downtown San Fransisco.
