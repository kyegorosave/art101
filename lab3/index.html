				<h2><u><b>Challenge</b></u></h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to sort your files hierachially and make sure they are on an organized basis to
						be able to navigate easier. Having your files sorted and easily able to navigate allows you to work more efficiently.

					<h2><u><b>Problems</b></u></h2>
					<p>I really didn't have any problems during this lab and I thought the directions were very straightforward.
					One problem I did run into was that I was trying to link the CSS file in the lab to the page instead of the 
					art101 folder css file. I wanted to do this to be able to change the background color and format some things on the page.

				<h2><u><b>Reflection</b></u></h2>
					<p>I found this lab to be very interesting and very much enjoyed it. I like when things are organzied because it just 
						makes everything look so much better. I put in a pretty good amount of effort for this assignment. Working with the 
						pre-made HTML file reallya aided in the process of me getting this done, but it also allowed to experiment more with things
						and try some styles out that I haven't before. Overall, really enjoyed this lab.
