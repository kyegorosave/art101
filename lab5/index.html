					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to make a Javascript function that we will implemnt 
						into our HTML and dislpay on the page. Through the car model, color, etc. program 
						the challenge was to make several different variables and a boolean and then implement it into
						run as a script.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Making the boolean gave me a little bit of an issue because I tried to use this <i>Boolean</i> function and it 
					was not agreeing with my VSCode JSNode at all, but it was eventually fixed. This lab proved to be one of the more difficult
					ones, since I'm sitll new to Javascript I was a little lost setting everything up. Figuring out all the problems wiht the Javascript
					and then going to mess with everything in CSS is a very relieving feeling.
					</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I thought this assignment was very fun actually and had a good time doing it. By using Javascript files IN the HTML makes me think of all
						the possibilities that can be done on websites. I realize now that drop-down menus and interative parts of websites are done THROGUH Javascript
						and I now realize the importance of it.
