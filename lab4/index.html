			<h1>Lab 4: Pseudocoding and Problem Solving - Kye Gorosave & Kaiwen Su</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2><u>Challenge</u></h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab is to confidently be able to plan out your code through 
						the method of pseudocoding. By doing so, you are able to plan things out before you start your actual coding, giving
						you a better basis to work off of and allowing you to work more efficiently. Working as a team and being able to plan things
						out and set things up to be able to work better is also another important aspect.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2><u>Problems</u></h2>
						<p>Didn't really have any problems during the process of making this. Everything was pretty straightforward and the 
						only problems I had were configuring the CSS file to get everything in working order. Adding the pre tags were
						kinda difficult too because it wasn't working for a sec, but I just realized I forgot to save my file and then it worked.
						Overall, good lab. 
					</p>

					<h2><u>Reflection</u></h2>
					<p>The assignment was actually pretty tame compared to the other labs. The directions were very straightforward and easy to
						follow. Ran into a few problem with the CSS file and the JS file, but eventually was able to figure it out. Put in a pretty good
						amount of effort for this lab. Worked hard on making the page looking pleasing and the colors worked well together. The 8-bit font too
						is a nice touch.

//Explain the rules of the game
	//Paper loses to scissors, rock loses to paper, and scissors lose to rock. 
//Ask the player for their choice at the beginning of each turn
	//Choose rock or paper or scissors

		OR player chooses paper and computer chooses rock DISPLAY “YOU WIN!”
	//else display “COMPUTER WINS!”
//Show computers choice and see if it was a win, draw, or loss and then ask them if they want to play again
