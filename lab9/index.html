        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>
            The challenge of this lab was to be able to properly incorporate jQuery into your HTML, get it working in JavaScript, and be 
            able to style it within CSS as well. Being able to properly use jQuery and implement it onto your page saves SO much time and can 
            improve your productivity by a significant amount.

        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>
            I ran into a couple of problems while working with my JavaScript and CSS. I got the button on the page and got everything working through jQuery, but it 
            looked so simplistic and boring so I tried making a bunch of changes to it, stylistically, and ended up messing everything up. I still wasn't going to 
            settle with a boring button, so I used GPT-4.0 for some help and it helped a pretty good amount. I originally had the button make the text boxes have a background glow
            around it to make it look "fancy", but I scrapped that and decided to do a kind of pulsing glow when the button was pressed. This was immensely hard for me to do and I was lost
            trying to figure out the animation function, but through GPT-4 and W3Schols I was eventually able to come up with something that made the page look good. jQuery is still very much 
            new to me, so this was one of the harder labs, but I am excited to see what else can be done with jQuery.
        </p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
            I am happy with the way the page turned out and think the buttons are a cool feature that I will definitely be trying out more. The animation when the button is pressed came out very well and it makes me think of differnt possibilities for page designs.
