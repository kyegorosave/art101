        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>
            The challenge of this lab was to use debugging knowledge that we learned from the lectures and apply it to our old labs to fix any previous issues we had.
            Debugging is one of the most important aspects of developing because whether you like it or not, bugs are going to happen in your code, so learning to debbug 
            properly and efficiently can save you from ripping your hair out.

        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>
            Ran into zero problems throughout the lab. Debugging labs 5 and 6 was easy and only had errors because it was an introduction to document.witeln and we didn't know what else to use yet.

            I debugged Lab 5. Here's some screenshots!

        <p>For this lab, I was getting errors in my console because of using "document.writeln". Using document.writeln with asynchronously loaded scripts just does not work at all and has the chance to overwrite the 
            entire document. It's easer to use some DOM manipulation instead, so I made a function called addTextToBody that creates a paragraph element, sets its text content, and then appends it to the body. Adding this doesnt make a super
            drastic, insane change to the site or anything, it just gets rid of the errors in the console and cleans things up a little.
