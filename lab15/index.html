        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>
            The challenge of this lab was to be able use jQuery and AJAX together in order to manipulate the DOM and get whatever
            it is you made displayed properly. jQuery has made itself known as a very important tool in JavaScript that allows you to cut your
            code lines by a drastic amount, but AJAX is a new tool that we are learning that I feel opens a whole new door of opportunities.

        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>
            Ran into a few problems during the process of this lab. The JavaScript was not displaying the Kanye quote at all, but I figured it out to because
            of my <span>"success:function(data)"</span> function just displaying to the console instead of on the screen. The Kanye head itself gave me a few issues
            as well, but working around with CSS on Google Chrome is so extremely useful and I was able to get it positioned correctly and have it how I wanted it.

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
            I like the way the page came out, I used a Kanye color way that I found on the internet. Press the "Activate" button below to see some <span>REAL</span>
            Kanye West quotes!
