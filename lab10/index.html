        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>
            The challenge of this lab was to be able to experiment with DOM manipulation through jQuery and JavaScript. DOM manipulation is an important part of web development since you can 
            create web applications that update the data in a web page without having to refresh the page. This allows for a lot more designs and processes that can be done on a page without having to
            refresh it every time.

        <p>
            I did not really run into any problems during the process of this lab. I did have one issue and it was because I forgot to put parantheses at the end of a bracket in my JS. It took me a little
            bit to figure that out, but once I did it was all working and I was able to start styling the output from the file JS script.

        <p>
            I am happy with the way this lab turned out. I went with a dark mode text message look instead of the light mode since it is easier on the eyes.
