					<h2>About Kye</h2>
					<p>My name is Kye Gorosave and I am a 3rd year transfer at UCSC. I took this class becuase I have an interest in Front-End 
						development and the class helped me dive into the topic. I have some development experience, but haven't been actively practicing 
						so I need a refresher on some stuff. I am from the San Diego area and live in a town named Murrieta. I moved to and have been
						living in San Jose for the last year and a half because WHY NOT?(I miss San Diego). In my free time I like to do a lot of random things
						to keep me occupied such as playing video games, volleyball, surfing(learning), going to the beach, reading a book outside, going on a hike,
						and riding motorcycles. FUN FACT: I have the same birthday as SHAQ, March 6th!</p>
